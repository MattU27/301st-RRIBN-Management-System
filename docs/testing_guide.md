# TESTING GUIDE
## EO 212 Promotion Algorithm Integration
### 301st RRIBN Management System

---

## üß™ HOW TO TEST THE ALGORITHM

### Step 1: Start Your Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Prescriptive Analytics
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login to your system
3. Navigate to **Analytics > Prescriptive Analytics**

### Step 3: Use the Test Integration Panel
You'll see a new blue testing panel at the top of your prescriptive analytics page:

#### **Test Panel Features:**
- **"Show Test Panel"** button - Expands the testing interface
- **"Run EO 212 Algorithm Test"** button - Executes the algorithm test
- **"Download Report"** button - Generates detailed test report

### Step 4: Run the Algorithm Test

1. **Click "Show Test Panel"** to expand the testing interface
2. **Click "Run EO 212 Algorithm Test"** 
3. **Wait for processing** (should take 1-2 seconds)
4. **Review results** in the test panel

#### **What the Test Does:**
- Generates 5 sample personnel with realistic military data
- Processes them through both old and new algorithms
- Compares scoring differences
- Validates EO 212 policy compliance
- Loads test data into your analytics dashboard

### Step 5: Analyze Test Results

#### **In the Test Panel:**
- ‚úÖ **Success/Failure Status**
- üìä **Personnel Count** and **EO 212 Compliance Rate**
- üìã **Algorithm Metadata** (policy basis, version)

#### **In the Main Dashboard:**
- Test data will populate your existing analytics display
- You'll see the 5 test personnel in the recommendation cards
- Scores will be calculated using the new EO 212 algorithm
- PDF reports will use the enhanced scoring system

### Step 6: Download Detailed Report

Click **"Download Report"** to get a comprehensive markdown file showing:
- Individual personnel comparisons (old vs new scores)
- Algorithm validation results
- Policy compliance analysis
- Detailed scoring breakdowns

## üîç WHAT TO LOOK FOR

### **Algorithm Validation**
- ‚úÖ **System Integrity Check** should pass
- ‚úÖ **Weight Distribution** should sum to 100%
- ‚úÖ **Score Ranges** should be 0-100
- ‚úÖ **Policy Compliance** should reference EO 212

### **Test Personnel Examples**

#### **High Performer (Expected ~85-95% score):**
- **MAJ Teresa Lopez** - Outstanding efficiency rating, multiple commendations
- Should show "PRIORITY PROMOTION" or "IMMEDIATE PROMOTION"

#### **Average Performer (Expected ~70-80% score):**
- **SGT Juan Dela Cruz** - Good performance, meets requirements
- Should show "RECOMMENDED" status

#### **Needs Development (Expected <60% score):**
- **PFC Robert Garcia** - Below training requirements, needs improvement
- Should show "NOT ELIGIBLE" or "DEVELOPMENT NEEDED"

### **Scoring Breakdown**
Each personnel card should show:
- **Enhanced total score** (based on 5-factor algorithm)
- **Policy compliance status**
- **Detailed recommendation**
- **PDF download capability**

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues:**

#### **Import Errors:**
```bash
# If you get import errors, check file paths:
Error: Cannot find module '@/utils/testPromotionAlgorithm'
```
**Solution:** Ensure all files are in the correct directories:
- `src/utils/promotionAlgorithm.ts`
- `src/utils/promotionAlgorithmIntegration.ts`
- `src/utils/testPromotionAlgorithm.ts`
- `src/app/analytics/prescriptive/test-integration.tsx`

#### **TypeScript Errors:**
```bash
# If you get TypeScript compilation errors:
npm run build
```
**Solution:** Check the console for specific errors and ensure all imports are correct.

#### **Test Panel Not Showing:**
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure the TestIntegration component is properly imported

#### **Test Fails to Run:**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors like:
‚ùå Algorithm test failed: [error message]
```
**Solution:** Look at the specific error message and check data validation.

## üìä EXPECTED TEST RESULTS

### **Sample Output:**
```
‚úÖ Algorithm tested successfully. 3 personnel found eligible using EO 212 criteria.

Personnel Summary:
- Total Tested: 5
- EO 212 Compliant: 3
- Average Score Improvement: +12.5%
- Policy Basis: Executive Order No. 212 (1939)
```

### **Individual Personnel Results:**
- **MAJ Teresa Lopez**: 94% (IMMEDIATE PROMOTION)
- **CPL Maria Santos**: 87% (PRIORITY PROMOTION)  
- **SGT Juan Dela Cruz**: 78% (RECOMMENDED)
- **2LT Carlos Reyes**: 65% (ELIGIBLE)
- **PFC Robert Garcia**: 42% (NOT ELIGIBLE)

## üéØ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before presenting to your panel, ensure:

- [ ] **Test runs successfully** without errors
- [ ] **All 5 test personnel** appear in the dashboard
- [ ] **Scores are realistic** and properly calculated
- [ ] **PDF reports generate** with enhanced data
- [ ] **Test report downloads** successfully
- [ ] **Algorithm metadata** shows EO 212 basis
- [ ] **Policy compliance** rates are documented

---

## üìã PRESENTING TO YOUR PANEL

### **Key Points to Demonstrate:**

1. **Policy Foundation:** Show the algorithm is based on EO 212 (1939)
2. **Transparent Scoring:** Demonstrate the 5-factor weighted system
3. **Algorithm Testing:** Run the test live to show functionality
4. **Comparison Results:** Show how enhanced algorithm differs from simple scoring
5. **Documentation:** Present the comprehensive test report

### **Demo Script:**
1. "This is our EO 212-based promotion algorithm implementation"
2. "Let me run a test to show how it works" (click test button)
3. "As you can see, it processes personnel using historical military promotion criteria"
4. "Here's the detailed breakdown showing policy compliance"
5. "The system generates audit trails and detailed reports for transparency"

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS

After successful testing:

1. **Integrate with real data** by replacing test data with actual personnel records
2. **Customize weights** if needed based on 301st RRIBN specific requirements
3. **Add more validation** rules as needed
4. **Deploy to production** once approved by command
