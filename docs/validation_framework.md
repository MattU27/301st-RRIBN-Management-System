  };
}
```

### 1.3 Audit Trail Requirements

                   PROMOTION_WEIGHTS.timeInGrade + 
                   PROMOTION_WEIGHTS.education + 
                   PROMOTION_WEIGHTS.training;
assert(Math.abs(totalWeight - 1.0) < 0.001, "Weights must sum to 1.0");
```

**Policy Mapping Validation:**
