# Email System Update

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the registration email system which wasn't sending confirmation emails after user registration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Email Service
- Added detailed logging to track email configuration and sending status
- Improved error handling with more descriptive error messages
- Added transporter verification to ensure the email service is correctly configured
- Created a fallback mechanism to attempt Gmail sending if the configured service fails
- Added retry logic to increase the chances of successful delivery

### 2. Created Environment Configuration Tools
- Created a script to generate `.env.production` and `.env.local` files
- Provided clear instructions for setting up email credentials
- Ensured proper configuration for production environments

### 3. Improved Registration Confirmation Email
- Enhanced the email template with better styling and information
- Added more useful details like registration date and status
- Included contact information for support
- Improved the messaging around account approval status

### 4. Added Email Testing API
- Created a new API endpoint at `/api/test-email` to test email functionality
- The endpoint tests both simple emails and registration confirmation emails
- Provides detailed diagnostic information about the email configuration
- Helps administrators verify email setup without going through registration

### 5. Documentation
- Created an `EMAIL_SETUP.md` guide with detailed instructions for configuring email
- Added step-by-step guidance for setting up Gmail with App Password
- Included troubleshooting steps for common email issues
- Provided security best practices for email credential management

## How to Test
1. Ensure your email credentials are properly set in `.env` or `.env.local`
2. Visit `/api/test-email?to=your-email@example.com` to test the email service
3. Check your inbox for the test emails
4. Review server logs for detailed information about the email sending process

## Additional Notes
- The system now sends emails to both primary and alternative email addresses when provided
- Email credentials should be kept secure and not committed to version control
- In production, use app-specific passwords for Gmail accounts with 2FA enabled
